- [ ] Make a simple shell script to install acados
- [ ] Make a docker file to install acados and with ROS as well
- [ ] Recreate the fixed wing simulations and compare run time between the two 
  - [ ] One not compiled
  - [ ] One with compiled 
- [ ] Figure out how to interact with ROS2 framework 

## Good code references 
For ROS integration:
https://github.com/ivanacollg/MPC_CollisionAvoidance/tree/main

## Setting up constraints properly

## Important notes
USE SQP_RTI or sequential programming for real time integration
